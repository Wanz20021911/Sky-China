                Methanol dehydrogenase (ADH) derived from Stearothermophilus was selected, the gene sequence of this enzyme was obtained from NCBI database, and two different label protein fusion modes were designed, namely, the CL2 gene was fused to the N-terminal (2A) and C-terminal (A2) of ADH protein, respectively.

            <p>For the first two weeks, we mainly use a brainstorming approach to discuss each student's ideas and get a comprehensive understanding of the IGEM competition by studying the official IGEM website in detail. Every Sunday night, we hold team meetings, which are designed to get the ideas of the team members to exchange and spark innovation. The discussion process was very relaxed and the team members showed great enthusiasm, so the meeting went very smoothly.</p>

            <p>We transferred two different expression plasmids into receptor cell BL21 respectively. After the target protein was expressed by engineering bacteria, the bacteria was broken up, and the target protein A2 was purified by nickel column, but no 2A was found after purification.<br>

            <p> We suspect that during the inoculation of 2A, we inserted the hybrid bacteria into the culture medium instead of our engineered bacteria, and thus did not obtain the target protein. Therefore, we plan to re-inoculate 2A; After discussion with the instructor, we found that our control group was not completely set up, we only set up the control group without enzyme, but with substrate, and the control group without enzyme and without substrate, so we planned to re-express A2, and then set up a more comprehensive control group to test A2 activity.</p>

            In addition, we retested the activity of A2 and found that A2 had some activity at a PH of 5.97. However, what is puzzling is that we tested the light absorption value at 340nm of the control group with only enzyme and no substrate, and found that its value also increased to a certain extent. Theoretically, when there is no substrate reaction with enzyme, there should be no change in light absorption value.</p>

            <p class="eng-p-learn">Learn:</p>
            <p> We thought about the reason and found that when PH was 5.97, white precipitates were produced in the test cupola. We analyzed that the PH was close to the isoelectric point of protein (A2), which caused the condensation of A2, thus increasing the light absorption value. We checked the isoelectric point of methanol dehydrogenase and found that its PI was about 6.02, which confirmed the correctness of our idea. Therefore, we need to retest its activity away from the isoelectric point A2. In addition, we thought that the addition of label CL2 might affect the enzyme's active center at the 5 'end, so we gave up 2A.</p>

                We retest A2's activity by resetting a series of PH gradients around 0.5-1 away from the A2 isoelectric point. In addition, since methanol itself has an inhibitory effect on the activity of A2, we also tested the activity of A2 at different substrate concentrations.

                We investigated the effect of hydrogen-rich water on seed germination of lettuce and Chinese cabbage. The detailed experimental scheme can be found in our experiment section.

            <p> In order to verify the effect of hydrogen-rich water on plants, we selected Chinese cabbage and lettuce seeds, soaked them for 5h, covered them with moist gauze, placed them in a constant temperature incubator at 28â„ƒ, and recorded the germination of the seeds.</p>
            <p class="eng-p-test">Test:</p>
            <p> Our experimental results are as follows: hydrogen-rich water has no obvious effect on the germination of lettuce and Chinese cabbage seeds. We wonder whether it is because the seeds themselves and the selected varieties have a high germination rate, so the promotion effect of hydrogen-rich water on the germination of plants is masked.<br>

            <p> Unfortunately, we have not observed that hydrogen-rich water can promote the germination of cabbage and lettuce seeds, so we have abandoned this indicator and plan to explore other aspects of plant growth to study the botanical effects of hydrogen-rich water.</p>

            <p> In order to explore whether hydrogen-rich water will affect the root growth of plants, we transplanted the sprouted Chinese cabbage seeds treated with water and hydrogen-rich water respectively. During the plant growth process, we will continue to use hydrogen-rich water and water for treatment, and record the change of their root length at different time periods during the plant growth process.</p>

            <p> The results of our experiment were shown in the figure below. We recorded the root length of the plants for 3 days and 5 days of growth. We found that the overall root system of Pak choi treated with hydrogen-rich water was longer than that treated with water, which was very surprising to us, indicating that hydrogen-rich water does promote plant growth.<br>

            <p> We found that 20ml HRW combined with 1.0g fertilizer was more effective than 20ml RO water combined with 1.0g fertilizer, so reducing fertilizer use with hydrogen-rich water may be a viable option.</p>
